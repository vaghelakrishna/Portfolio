**Timeline:** 2 months  
**Role:** Full Stack  
**Team:** Solo  
**Status:** Completed  

**Overview:**  
NotesBuddy is a modern notes sharing platform that allows users to read notes, give quizzes, revise from flashcards, execute code snippets, and access previous year questions (PYQs).

**What Users Can Do:**  
• **Find Notes:** Search and access notes by year or semester (1st to 4th year)  
• **Share Resources:** Share notes and materials with friends  
• **Use Flashcards:** Practice with interactive flashcards for active recall  
• **Attempt Quizzes:** Test your knowledge with practice quizzes  
• **Access PYQs:** Get previous year questions with answers  
• **One-Shots:** Quick review materials for last-minute prep  
• **Topper Notes:** Handwritten notes from top-performing students  
• **AI Study Assistant (Coming soon):** Get instant answers to study questions  
• **Video Material:** Watch video explanations for better understanding  

**Why I Built This:**  
I built this platform to solve fundamental issues I faced while studying:  
• Professors don't share notes with students  
• Topper notes are not available to everyone  
• Notes are scattered & not organized  
• Reading one note and then another is painful with no sync, same examples, and inconsistent writing style  
• I wanted a customizable reading experience instead of PDFs  

**Tech Stack:**  
Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Zod, React Hook Form, Razorpay SDK, Monaco Editor, MDX Integration  

**After Launch & Impact:**  
• 1700+ users in 2 months  
• 200k views in 3 months, averaging 15k views during exams  
• 90+ Premium users in the same duration  
• Learned SEO, optimization, and how to build a user-focused product  
• Collected feedback to continuously improve the platform  
• Identified a memory leak in Velite affecting performance  
• Built a custom CMS for full platform control  
• Leveraged MDX and custom components for a better learning experience  

**Future Plans:**  
• Improve CMS system efficiency and scalability  
• Add AI Study Assistant  
• Scale the platform to enterprise level
